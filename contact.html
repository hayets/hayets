					<p>During the quarantine, I felt stuck in my flat, where I shared with another 10 people. At first, it was nice to spend more time with them, like I found out one of my roommates is nearsighted and he has a pair of cool glasses. But later on, I became sensitive since I could hear the people around me doing other things when I was working, which made it hard for me to be focused. And the situation got worse, little daily matters would put me in a bad mood, like the dirty dishes piled up in the sink with flies buzzing around, the rotten onion stuck in the corner of the fridge, and even my messy long hair were driving me nuts.</p>

					<p>I spent a Friday night camping on the rooftop and had the best sleeping quality during the past three weeks. However, the other day after I woke up, I had a strong feeling not to leave the tent since it gave me a sense of security, yet the question "what am I afraid of?" popped up. I inherited the doing from our ancestors by building up a wall or a barrier to protect myself against outside interference, which sparked me with the idea of visualizing everything that pissed me off into a picture. This is how prehistoric people did when they were trying to express something, and I feel that there is no word for me to deliver those complex emotions. Still, the images, as you can see from the sidewall, those feelings piled up like a pyramid drawn by me and other of my roommate </p>

					<p>And this idea extended to the wall nearby. I tried to recreate a story from "the allegory of the cave" on the second wall. When the cave inhabitants compete on comparing the height of two hands' shadows, the person who has gone to the bright world then back to the cave can't adapt to the darkness again, so he lost to the one who stayed in the shelter for the whole time. We are the people who might have been exposed to the sun, and the pandemic brought us back to the place black as soot. The failure to tell the height doesn't mean we are narrow-sighted but merely haven't adapted to the darkroom yet.</p>

					<p>I was reflecting on the idea that we are all cave inhabitants again. I took the picture from Paul Klee's famous work "Strong Dream" to express the complete lockdown, stay at home, and inconvenience, which is a powerful dream for me after calming myself in the tent. The moon seems more significant than the sun inside the house since I can't tell what's happening outside. And the unfortunate news upside down in the usual world I know.  However, I prefer to explain that the whole situation is a nightmare since I see the courage when so many unknown people are fighting against the invisible enemy. We are the ones who lied under the sun and the moon of Paul Klee's work, having a solid dream now in reality.</p>

							I wrote, "walkin' on the sun" on the fourth wall, with two question marks beneath. After I got used to the cave, the question comes from whether I will still have the courage to walk into the bright world. If I am willing to come out from the tent, it means I am ready to face those dirty dishes and apologize to my other roommates in a peaceful mood. Two question marks created the shape of a keyhole. It's a question and the answer at the same time.</p>
